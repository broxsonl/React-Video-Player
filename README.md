### Video Player App Build in React to model Youtube

Simple application built using React and youtube's search API. 

App allows the search of Youtube for the top five videos of any search terms. As a result of significantly less content displayed on the screen, load times are preferable to using Youtube itself.

A fun and useful app to build to help improve understanding the utilization of React.
